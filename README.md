this repository is related to my final project in my course, where the idea of my team (me and 5 other people) was to created a simple version of an ERP for an automotive workshop
that is capable of manage (CRUD operations) such basic sectors, as the following:

- financing
- employee (HR)
- customer
- service order & quote
- supplier
- stock & product
